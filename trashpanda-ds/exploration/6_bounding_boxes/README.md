# Finding Borders for YOLO

`find_borders.py`

A brief python script for making and previewing bounding boxes for images in a specified subdirectory (currenty hardcoded to `tires`). Further more practical application for making  (but not previewing) is in the directory `multifile_labeling` which descends into the directory `images`. See README there for more details
