# ZIP Code Webscrape

Before we got access to the Earth 911 API, we thought we had to webscrape the database for recycling locations. To do so, we needed every zip code in the 50 US states to get said locations for all parts of the country.

All ZIP codes were webscraped from zip-codes.com. Since ZIP codes change frequently, the output file, `all_US_zipcodes.txt`,  not not be accurate after this writing.
