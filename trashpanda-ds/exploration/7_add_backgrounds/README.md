# Add background

Adds backgrounds to (usually) png files with transparent backgrounds


a directory `input` is provided with some transparent images as well as a `bg` which contains backgrounds.

As written Running `add_backgrounds.py` will create a directory, `output` which wil contain all subfolders of `input` but with backgrounds appended
