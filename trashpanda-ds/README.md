## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/trashpanda-ds/projects)

[Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/d2e8748fdffe4c66a0a6641582dd6b63?v=4c919ea10f204aa89cd9184d59a9e6f4)

Trash Panda is an app that uses image recognition AI to help you recycling better. You may search through a list of categories, enter in a material to our search bar, or use your camera to scan the item and discover how to properly dispose of your material! A lot of things end up in garbage bags sent off to the landfill when they might have a better way of being disposed. With Trash Panda, you will become wiser at disposing items and be better to our planet!
Youâ€™ll receive proper disposal information specific to your location if you live in the USA. Currently, Trashpanda provides international users with an AI result and general information about how materials can be disposed of properly, but it will not provide disposal locations for international postal codes.
