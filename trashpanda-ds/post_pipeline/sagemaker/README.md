# Sagemaker, S3 Bucket & GitHub Repository

### S3 Bucket: **the-trash-panda**

### Sagemaker Instance type: **ml.t2.medium**

### Sagemaker notebook: **sagemaker_notebook**

### S3 Bucket: **the-trash-panda**


The S3 bucket the-trash-panda is now available for use on sagemaker and connected to our new sagemaker_notebook and can be connected to any other new notebooks on this same account. This notebook is connected to our GitHub Repo and the repo is now part of the AWS project historic. 

Our S3 has another bucket called saved-weights where we saved all our weights after training the model. They can be easily accessed.


The Repository and the S3 bucket can be connected to other possible new notebooks. The way the notebook was created, it can take any other S3 buckets, in case needed.
